Day 20: ECMAScript, ES6 Classes & Inheritance<br/>

👨‍💻 Day 20 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today was all about ECMAScript and ES6+ OOP features. Here's what I covered:<br/>

📜 ECMAScript: Got a deeper understanding of ECMAScript, the standard behind JavaScript that drives modern language features.<br/>

🏫 ES6 Classes: Learned about the new class syntax in ES6, which simplifies object-oriented programming and makes it more readable and organized.<br/>

🔧 Static Methods: Explored static methods that allow defining functions on the class itself, rather than instances.<br/>

🧬 Inheritance: Applied inheritance to extend classes, creating child classes with shared functionality from a parent class.<br/>

🚀 Tomorrow: I'll build a film project using all these concepts in action. Stay tuned!<br/>

On to building! 🎬
